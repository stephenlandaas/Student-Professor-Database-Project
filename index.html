                <h2>Welcome to our CPSC 332 Term Project!</h2>
                <p>This project utilizes a wide variety of programming languages and technologies to create an interactive, enjoyable user experience. At the start of containing this site, we truthfully didn't think we'd be able to complete it in time, due to the overwhelming block of work that resided ahead of us. Prior to this class, we only had very limited exposure to front-end languages such as HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of JavaScript. However, none of us had any experience working with SQL or PHP before.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, once we obtained the instructions for this project, we started by getting to work on the ER diagram and relational model, which would set us up for our database structure. This was a rather lengthy process, and one we required a bit of guidance on (courtesy of our professor). Nevertheless, we pushed through and were able to create a fully functional ER Diagram and Relational model.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Once this task was completed, we set out to design our database using mySQL, connecting ourselves to Fullerton's database server, where we could then create our tables. Creating our tables and populating them with sample data was a rather easy process, yet it was tedious and painstaking, but it wasn't too challenging fortunately. Once our tables were created and populated with a handful of sample students, professors, and courses, we realized it was time to move on.</p>
                <br>
                <p>From there, we used the website <a href="https://replit.com/~" target="_blank">Repl.it</a> to write some queries on a sample database. We chose to use this site because it was usable by all 3 of us at any given time, whereas the Fullerton server was only accessible by one of us at a time. For about a day or so, we rigorously tested our queries, and were able to get them working without any issues.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Once we were able to get our queries working, we decided it was time to start with the front-end of our website. Here we used basic HTML5 and CSS3 to design the layout of our website, which wasn't too difficult aside from some particular styling. Finally, we utilized PHP to link our website forms with our datbase server, and we were able to produce the right output.</p>
                <br>
                <p>At the end of the semester and upon submission, we were thrilled to have accomplished such a monumental task, and we couldn't have been any happier with our progress. From starting with a mere diagram and working our way to a fully responsive and interactive website, we were stunned and what we could do, and all of us are proud to present you with this work.</p>
